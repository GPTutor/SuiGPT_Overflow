# What is SuiGPT?

SuiGPT is a tool that uses a Large Language Model to decompile and beautify Sui contracts. Even if users have concerns about the contracts, they can get answers by asking the SuiGPT Chatbot and posting on community discussion boards.

# Why SuiGPT?

Smart contracts are a crucial component of the Sui Ecosystem. However, since they are written in Move and published in bytecode, non-technical users frequently need help understanding the function of the smart contracts they intend to use.

Furthermore, beginner developers often struggle to understand the complex logic of existing smart contracts. This challenge persists even when contracts are open-source or can be decompiled using tools such as Revela. As a result, developers may find themselves at a loss on how to begin writing their own contracts or how to correctly use existing modules in their projects.

This challenge persists even when contracts are open-source or can be decompiled using tools such as Revela. As a result, developers may find themselves at a loss on how to begin writing their own contracts or how to correctly use existing modules in their projects.

To solve the two problems mentioned above, there is a need for a community platform that allows non-technical users and novice developers to easily understand, review, and audit Sui Move smart contracts. This is why we built SuiGPT. With the help of cutting-edge AI technology, any user can easily read and understand smart contracts on the blockchain with the help of the latest Large Language Models. Moreover, through a community discussion forum, the community can exchange comments and audit reports on smart contracts.

In addition, based on the high-quality production code decompiled by the SuiGPT, we are creating a dataset to train AI to generate a Sui Move smart contract based on the users’ instructions. This can help novice developers kick-start their projects and even empower non-technical users to customize their Sui move contract in a no-code fashion. The code generation pipeline is also demoed at the SuiGPT Frontend.

The performance of SuiGPT will further improve with the arrival of more powerful large language models, becoming a cornerstone of the Sui ecosystem and continuing to assist developers and users.

In Sum, we expect SuiGPT to contribute to the Sui Community with the following:

1. Open Source on Sui: Using SuiGPT to decompile contracts can facilitate the openness, transparency, and promotion of open source within the Sui ecosystem.
2. Educating Developers: SuiGPT can decompile and generate smart contracts, allowing developers to understand how others write Sui contracts. Learning through examples in this way can be very efficient.
3. Educating Non-Technical Users: SuiGPT enables non-technical users to read and understand contracts, informing them about the behind-the-scenes connections of various PTBs (presumably some technical components or processes) and how these PTBs operate.
4. Beautifying Contracts for Developers: The contracts decompiled by SuiGPT are beautified and optimized versions, saving developers time on beautifying contracts.
5. Boost Sui Move auditing: As audit fees are calculated by line count, beautified contracts are not only cheaper but are also easier for auditors to read. Moreover, auditors can use SuiGPT’s chatting interface to collaborate with AI during the audit process.
